# stock-analysis
Python software to web-scrape live & historical stock & cryptocurrency data for free. This avoids having to pay for a premium API. Data is possible to be retrieved every 4 seconds for stocks, and every minute for cryptocurrency.
Data is then plotted, and information about the stock is displayed around the side. A lagrangian interpolation line is also plotted on top for prediction. 
The option to upload the retrieved data to an online backup source is offered. This is also through a free source.
All goals set out at the start of the project were achieved.
